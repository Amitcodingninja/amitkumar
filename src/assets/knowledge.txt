For making responsive 

className="grid gap-8 sm:max-xl:bg-blue-50 sm:max-xl:p-9 md:grid-cols-2 md:items-center md:text-left"

In About 
// I added `id="about"` to the `<section>` element to enable linking from the header. This allows the "About" link to scroll to this section when clicked.

Key Changes Explained:
Responsive Padding (px-4 py-16 md:px-16 md:py-32):

Added responsive padding for the main-container class to adjust the padding based on screen size. It uses smaller padding on mobile and increases for medium screens and larger devices.
Text Section Width (w-full sm:w-2/3):

On small screens, the text container takes up full width (w-full), and on larger screens (from sm breakpoint), it takes up 2/3 of the width (sm:w-2/3).
Font Sizes:

Adjusted the font size for different screen sizes using Tailwind's responsive classes like text-4xl sm:text-5xl for the main header and text-xl sm:text-3xl for subheadings, making text larger on larger screens.
Paragraph Text Size (text-sm sm:text-base):

The paragraph text is smaller (text-sm) on mobile and increases to a larger size (sm:text-base) on larger screens for better readability.
Social Media Icons:

flex justify-center sm:justify-start: Centers the icons on small screens and aligns them to the left on larger screens using sm:justify-start.
px-4 py-4 w-14 h-14 sm:w-16 sm:h-16: Sets the icons' size to w-14 h-14 on mobile and increases to w-16 sm:h-16 on larger screens for better visibility.
text-3xl sm:text-4xl: Ensures the icon size is smaller on mobile (text-3xl) and grows larger on bigger screens (sm:text-4xl).
Image (w-48 sm:w-64 md:w-80):

The image is set to w-48 for small screens, and as the screen size increases, it grows to sm:w-64 and md:w-80 for larger devices.
These adjustments ensure that the Banner component is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes smoothly.
